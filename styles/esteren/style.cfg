# Custom documentation:
# Global functions must declare this var:
# 'U_JOIN_LEADERS_GROUP'	=> append_sid("{$phpbb_root_path}ucp.$phpEx", 'i=ucp_groups&mode=membership'),
# It's used to allow easier handling of the leaders' group invitation.
# Also, "$user->add_lang('groups');" must be added to viewtopic.php
